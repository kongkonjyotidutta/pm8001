Rev 0.1.36.F06      mgs     December 13 2011

- OSG-33 Add ability to adjust individual phy analog settings with
  /lib/firmware/pm8001.nv.json. Set some StingRay specific defaults.
- NEO-238 On ssp event IO_XFER_OPEN_RETRY_TIMEOUT issue an abort, escalate
  to a phy reset if cannot then return command with a status to retry.

  of enclosures.

- CR39789/TI39/OSG-60 add pm8001_eh_host_reset_handler (original effort from
  TimM in 0.1.36.e21 timeframe).
- OSG-50 Discovered that timeouts are not propagated properly for aborts and
  other administrivia, added error code into internal tmf task handler and
  ensure only valid values for query task are propagated. Add locking to
  pm8001_bar4_shift. Add PHY_FUNC_GET_EVENTS handler while we are here. Remove
  3.rb_access (PMC identified it as problematic) and added 3.rb.configure.

Rev 0.1.36.F07      mgs     December 16 2011

- OSG-42 Add r/w access to VPD. Reformat VPD to support individual per-phy
  WWNs. Add the pm8001-wwn startup script.
- OSG-165 Increase circular mpi queues to 1024
- OSG-261 Decrease outstanding commands from 510 to 508 to provide double
  the margin for event and administrivia packets.
- OSG-503 pm8001 is not setting wwn on some StingRays
  expand PCI busses the PLX can be discovered to 1 through 9.

Rev 0.1.36.F08     dja     August 29 2012

- OSG-531 kernel panic on hot-pull of drive during write.
These changes add cleanup for the abort paths so that all pending commands
will be aborted before the reset operation completes.  The libsas layer
expects this to be the case and double frees will occur if any ccb's
which have been cleaned up by the error handler are subsequently
completed by the driver.

Rev 0.1.36.F08     mgs     October 25 2012

- NEO-838 VPD individual wwn per phy is sub-optimal.
- NEO-838 VPD pair of x4 wwns is sub-optimal.
- OSG-680 change PM8001_RESERVED_CCB to 176

Rev 0.1.36.F08     mgs     November 26 2012
